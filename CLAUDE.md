## Instructions for Claude Code

### Two-Step Rule (mandatory)
**Step 1 — Orient:** Use wiki articles to find WHERE things live.
**Step 2 — Verify:** Read the actual source files listed in the wiki article BEFORE writing any code.

Wiki articles are structural summaries extracted by AST. They show routes, models, and file locations.
They do NOT show full function logic, middleware internals, or dynamic runtime behavior.
**Never write or modify code based solely on wiki content — always read source files first.**

Read in order at session start:
1. `.codesight/wiki/index.md` — orientation map (~200 tokens)
2. `.codesight/wiki/overview.md` — architecture overview (~500 tokens)
3. Domain article (e.g. `.codesight/wiki/auth.md`) → check "Source Files" section → read those files
4. `.codesight/CODESIGHT.md` — full context map for deep exploration

Routes marked `[inferred]` in wiki articles were detected via regex — verify against source before trusting.
If any source file shows ⚠ in the wiki, re-run `npx codesight --wiki` before proceeding.

Or use the codesight MCP server for on-demand queries:
   - `codesight_get_wiki_article` — read a specific wiki article by name
   - `codesight_get_wiki_index` — get the wiki index
   - `codesight_get_summary` — quick project overview
   - `codesight_get_routes --prefix /api/users` — filtered routes
   - `codesight_get_blast_radius --file src/lib/db.ts` — impact analysis before changes
   - `codesight_get_schema --model users` — specific model details

Only open specific files after consulting codesight context. This saves ~44,297 tokens per conversation.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
